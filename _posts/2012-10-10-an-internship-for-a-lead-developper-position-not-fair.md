As a web entrepreneur, I've been looking closely at the Startup Weekend events
- I've been a participant myself - and I've kept following some
successful projects. Among them is Jimmy Fairly, which won the
Startup Weekend Toulouse in November 2010. It has an interesting
business model (including the classic "remove intermediates"), had
raised 200kâ‚¬ in just 3 weeks (about 250 k$) and managed to create great
brand in just a few months. Jimmy Fairly even opened a store in Paris
a few months ago. I was very surprised when I came into this
[ad](https://remixjobs.com/emploi/Developpement/Lead-Developpeur-PHP-Zend-Framework-H-F/16208),
posted on a well known [job board for startups in France](http://remixjobs.com),

They're looking for a lead developer, but for an internship (stage,
in french).
For those unfamiliar with that job title, it usually involves high level
software designing (sometimes referred as software architecture) or
team leading. Something you would normally not give to a junior with practically no experience.

# Job ad Excerpt

Here's an excerpt of the ad, translated into English.


<blockquote><p>
You will have an important role within the technical team, responsible
for coordinating all development projects closely
with other company's officers.<br/>
Required skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mastering of Object oriented PHP, HTML5 and CSS</li>
<li>Mastering of a PHP Framework</li>
<li>First Experience as lead developer</li>
<li>Notions of system administration would be a plus</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


I thought at first that the job was badly categorized, but it's
probably not. The company published several other
positions on the job board, and of all 25 positions, 24 (or 23, it depends how you read it) were for internships while most of
job titles make me think about a full fledged job : Web developer, Product
manager, Office manager, Community manager.

I don't know the specifics about Jimmy Fairly - it may not be like it
seems or like I get it - but how come apparently serious and solid
companies would propose an internship for an experienced profile, with great
responsibilities or would have more interns than employees ?

Probably because it is a cheap way to get the job done, and
with all young people looking to work at the end of their studies or
after them, it's easy and fast. But morally questionable.

The job board where I found the ad contains a lot of others that should be (IMHO) a
real job offer. The most puzzling one being "Looking for a CEO
right-hand man / project manager", asking the candidate to
help defining the company strategy and follow subcontractors. 

According discussions with former trainees that have been in a similar
situations, managers justified their actions because of economic constraints or that students were not really against this type of work, only slackers were. Bullshit !


# An unfortunate habit

[More and more companies are relying on internship][nytimes]
for positions that should be normally for employees.

To some managers, trainees are only an inexpensive, skilled, motivated workforce.
A significant portion of them is desperate about getting an internship, since it is often required to finish their studies. Furthermore, a lot of job offers for junior require a first experience in the field. 
In France (I could not say for other countries, but I guess it's the same), they do not have the same rights as traditional employees - in terms of hours of work, vacations, profit sharing, job termination notice or indemnities - it is easy to take advantage of the situation.

Sure, it's cheap and a clueless manager/CFO may congratulate you for finding a
pair of hands while helping lowering costs, but it is a very
short-term view that does not include the perspective of management
skills or the durability of the company. To me, it is also immoral :
if the company needs someone to do the classic work of an employee,
under similar conditions (time, cost, quality), then it needs to be a real
employee ! Plus, the company is risking to be sued for unreported
employment or unfair competition.

I can't trust a company (read: not a startup in its first months or
that never raised funds) that gives a critical position as an
internship or has more interns than employees. And probably neither should customers, job candidates or
investors.

# What do successful companies ?

Truth is that we do need trainees because their presence is a win-win for both students and companies.

Students need opportunities to confront real problems with
real customer cases, but it's not a justification to abuse the system
and deny the student a proper supervision or training.  They're
learning, experimenting, challenging, getting feedback and support from seniors. They're not meant
to be producing professional quality grade material on their own :
they still need guidance.

The company will have access to highly qualified profiles with
potential support of the teaching team, access to research programs or student/ex-students networks. At the end of the internship,
the trainee will know specifics of projects and the company ways, making
him a good candidate for employment.  An internship is also an excellent time to fail and learn from errors
either for the student or for the company.

If Google, Yahoo and other big companies take care of their employees and
their students, it is because they understand that their collaborations is a great source of improvement.

There are positions at Google called "People Development" (let's say Human Resources) which moto is

<blockquote><p>
Find them, Grow them, Keep them
</p></blockquote>

They refer themselves as People Ops - a reference to [Devops][devops],
a movement aimed at making software, operational and QA teams
collaborate on business objectives and value production - and are all about creating an [environment to promote passion][google_environment], where the right people would be able to innovate, progress, and succeed. In this regard, they've built [bridges][google_research] between their teams and universities to maximize interactions between Googlers and students. 

As stated in [Interns making an Impact: Time Blakely][interns_making_an_impact], 


<blockquote><p>
Our interns explore new ideas, accelerate the launch of new product
features, and are big contributors to Google. Technical interns are
embedded in every major engineering team where their impact is
unconstrained by titles. 
</p></blockquote>


# Bottom line

If you're doing it cheaply, chances are that you'll end up with
something cheap (as in poor quality).

If you're serious about your product or company,
be serious about your team.

## Update 25 November 2012
I don't know precisely when it happened but the intership position is filled.
